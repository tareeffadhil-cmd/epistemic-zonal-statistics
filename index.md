# Epistemic Zonal Statistics (EZS)

**Epistemic Zonal Statistics (EZS)** is a conceptual and methodological initiative that advances **position-aware** and **certainty-aware** statistical inference beyond global summaries such as means, standard deviations, and single p-values.

Rather than assuming uniform evidential strength across a dataset, EZS argues that **the credibility of inference varies locally** depending on where data points lie within the distribution.

## Motivation

Classical statistical summaries are indispensable, but they implicitly assume that evidential support is evenly distributed across observations. In practice, this assumption rarely holds.

Important epistemic structure—regions where inference is **stable**, **transitional**, or **fragile**—can remain hidden when analysis relies exclusively on global metrics.

EZS addresses this blind spot by introducing **zonal interpretation frameworks** that explicitly distinguish between:

- **Positional structure**  
  (e.g., SD-based partitions of the distribution)

- **Epistemic certainty**  
  (e.g., SE-scaled inferential zones)

---

## Core Ideas

- Local variability can be masked by global standard deviation  
- Standard error–defined partitions provide epistemic meaning to positional regions  
- Not all data points contribute equally to defensible inference  
- Statistical evidence should be interpreted relative to its position in the distribution  
- Global averages may overstate reliability and obscure inequities

## Scope of the Initiative

This repository serves as a hub for:

- Conceptual whitepapers and position statements  
- Methodological notes and illustrative examples  
- Open discussions on epistemic inference  
- Invited essays and scholarly commentaries  
- Future open-source tools and demonstrations  

---

## Current Status

This is an **early-stage, founder-led initiative**.

The project is intentionally lightweight to encourage:

- Interdisciplinary dialogue  
- Methodological critique  
- Publisher and community engagement  

EZS is not positioned as a finished framework, but as a **starting point for a new epistemic conversation in statistics**.
