Epistemic Zonal Statistics (EZS): A conceptual and methodological initiative exploring position-aware and certainty-aware statistical inference beyond global summaries.
# Epistemic Zonal Statistics (EZS)

Epistemic Zonal Statistics (EZS) is a conceptual and methodological initiative that advances position-aware and certainty-aware statistical inference beyond global summaries such as means, standard deviations, and single p-values.

## Motivation

Classical statistical summaries often assume uniform evidential support across data distributions. In practice, inference strength varies locally across positional regions of the data. Important epistemic structure—where inference is stable, transitional, or fragile—may remain hidden when analysis is restricted to global metrics.

EZS addresses this blind spot by introducing zonal interpretation frameworks that distinguish between:

- **Positional structure** (e.g., SD-based partitions)
- **Epistemic certainty** (e.g., SE-scaled inferential zones)

## Core Ideas

- Local variability can be masked by global standard deviation  
- Standard error–defined partitions provide epistemic meaning to positional regions  
- Not all data points contribute equally to defensible inference  
- Statistical evidence should be interpreted relative to its position in the distribution  

## Scope of the Initiative

This repository serves as a hub for:

- Conceptual whitepapers and position statements  
- Methodological notes and illustrative examples  
- Open discussions on epistemic inference  
- Invited essays and scholarly commentaries  
- Future open-source tools and demonstrations  

## Current Status

This is an early-stage, founder-led initiative intended to encourage:

- Interdisciplinary dialogue  
- Methodological critique  
- Publisher and community engagement  

## Founder
